It focuses more on how to build container images for ARM in the absence of native ARM runners and the state of such things in mid-2024 (this means any improvements made after mid-2024 were not considered when writing this content). GitHub Actions Primer GitHub allows bu...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Dragon Ball Super - Zamasu Timeline 101</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/dbs-zamasu-timeline/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dragon Ball Super - Zamasu Timeline 101" /><published>2024-02-03T23:19:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-02-03T23:19:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/dbs-zamasu-timeline/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/dbs-zamasu-timeline/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Just Fun Things" /> <summary>Whats and Whys I did a similar writeup on Dragon Ball Z’s Cell saga timeline earlier. Just like in Z, Super also had a saga involving Future Trunks and, therefore, another time travel mystery. An in-depth understanding of this timeline isn’t necessary to enjoy the story. Like Z, many people feel there are only two timelines in the Zamasu saga of Dragon Ball Super. I’ll present my theories on h...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Wallabag in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-wallabag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wallabag in Home Lab" /><published>2024-01-20T11:37:19-05:00</published> <updated>2024-01-20T11:37:19-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-wallabag/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-wallabag/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Wallabag is a read-it-later application for storing bookmarks. It automatically extracts the readable text and images and stores in a reader-format, which can also be exported as PDF, TXT, EPUB, and more. The best way to use it is to throw in blogs and links we find everyday and get back to them later when free. Wallabag can be deployed using docker-compose. I recommend doing it with a contain...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Bookmark Manager in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-linkwarden/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bookmark Manager in Home Lab" /><published>2024-01-15T01:03:10-05:00</published> <updated>2024-01-15T01:03:10-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-linkwarden/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-linkwarden/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Intro There are probably a hundred different ways to manage links and bookmarks. People use Chrome’s bookmarks, some use an extension like Toby, and others store them on GitHub. There are also many bookmark manager apps, dashboard applications, and even command-line tools that can manage bookmarks. Once again, I turn to the amazing open-source community in search of projects. I identified 3 p...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Personal Finance Budgeting in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-budgeting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Personal Finance Budgeting in Home Lab" /><published>2024-01-14T15:53:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-01-14T15:53:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-budgeting/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-budgeting/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Intro Personal finance is more than just a practice - it’s a skill. But at the same time, finding a good, privacy-focused application to help manage personal finances is very hard. Many applications are either paywalled for tiers of features, or hold your data hostage to make migration harder. Of course, there are good paid services as well, but an open-source application that can be deployed ...</summary> </entry> </feed>
