First and foremost, its ability to produce standalone binaries, similar to C, is HUGE! Unlike Python, I don’t need to worry about where the final code would execute, everything can be just packaged together. YES, I know we can ultimately get Python to do something similar, but ...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Expense Tracking in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-budgetlord/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Expense Tracking in Home Lab" /><published>2024-12-14T09:10:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-12-14T09:10:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-budgetlord/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-budgetlord/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Whats and Whys I wrote a tool called BudgetLord for one straightforward reason - to track expenses. There are so So sO SO many tools out there that do the same. And they do it so well, with so many features. What I wrote is very simple, so why not just use one of the existing tools? I was using one too! I preferred Spendee for a while but migrated from it. I also looked at Cashew, but still mi...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Leantime in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-fusion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Leantime in Home Lab" /><published>2024-11-10T12:37:19-05:00</published> <updated>2024-11-10T12:37:19-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-fusion/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-fusion/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Fusion is an RSS feed aggregator which has an inbuilt reader interface for articles too. It’s very easy to setup and is what I use for my reading day to day. It has a quick mark as read feature too, which allows me to manage my articles effectively. To deploy this, use Docker in the command line like so → docker run --rm -it -d -p 8080:8080 \ -v $(pwd)/fusion:/data \ -e PASSWORD=&amp;quot;a strong pas...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Exploring RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Talking to my Notes</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/ai-rag/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Talking to my Notes" /><published>2024-11-04T18:12:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-11-04T18:12:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/ai-rag/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/ai-rag/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Computers and Security" /> <summary>Preamble → This blog is a collection of my research and experimentation over two days to learn about RAG and LLMs. The main idea I was chasing was to set up RAG as a service (RAGaaS) - it’s pretty straightforward! Point a container (or a multi-container stack) to a directory containing notes or files and be able to talk to an LLM about it. I don’t know much about machine learning and this post ...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Containerized Security Toolkit - A Guide</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/cst-guide/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Containerized Security Toolkit - A Guide" /><published>2024-10-26T13:52:00-04:00</published> <updated>2024-10-26T13:52:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/cst-guide/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/cst-guide/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Computers and Security" /> <summary>Since writing this blog, I’ve updated the project significantly with multiple image options.
