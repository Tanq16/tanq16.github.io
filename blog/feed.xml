A prevalent way people use this feature is by setting up a Slack or Discord channel to send events there. While for general use cases, it does allow customizing which events get sent; I found it lacking in two areas → It doesn’t allow customization of the actor; for examp...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reverse Proxy in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-npm/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reverse Proxy in Home Lab" /><published>2025-01-29T19:11:00-05:00</published> <updated>2025-01-29T19:11:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-npm/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-npm/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Whats and Whys?

It also forwards back the response from the origin server and is considered part of the “client” when dumbing down client-server communication. Forward proxies (usually just called a proxy) is very commonly used for various purposes. A reverse proxy does a similar pa...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Way to Go(lang)</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/go-coding/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Way to Go(lang)" /><published>2024-12-14T13:12:00-05:00</published> <updated>2024-12-14T13:12:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/go-coding/</id> <content type="text/html" src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/go-coding/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Computers and Security" /> <summary>When I started exploring new programming languages and tooling, Go caught my attention for several compelling reasons.
