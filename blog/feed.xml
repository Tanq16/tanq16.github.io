Point a container (or a multi-container stack) to a directory containing notes or files and be able to talk to an LLM about it. I don’t know much about machine learning and this post ...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Containerized Security Toolkit - A Guide</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/cst-guide/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Containerized Security Toolkit - A Guide" /><published>2024-10-26T13:52:00-04:00</published> <updated>2024-10-26T13:52:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/cst-guide/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/cst-guide/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Computers and Security" /> <summary>This blog is a guide on using the Containerized Security Toolkit, a project I maintain. The repository contains a quickstart command to instantly jump into a running instance. This guide, however, describes advanced workflows and usage of the toolkit. Quickstart In this section, I describe a nuanced quickstart (includes a couple more settings than shown in the README) on using a containerize...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Effective Note-Taking</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/newbified-effective-notes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Effective Note-Taking" /><published>2024-10-13T07:21:00-04:00</published> <updated>2024-10-13T07:21:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/newbified-effective-notes/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/newbified-effective-notes/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Computers Newbified" /> <summary>Intent I’m not the best at taking notes, and I’ve been pursuing a goal for improving my note-taking ever since I started my Masters degree. During that time, I discovered Notion, which gave me a lot of control over my notes, inspired me to take more notes and build a “dashboard” of sorts, popularized a lot on YouTube. I also discovered the concept of Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte and ...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>Leantime in Home Lab</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-leantime/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Leantime in Home Lab" /><published>2024-08-10T13:37:19-04:00</published> <updated>2024-08-10T13:37:19-04:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-leantime/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/homelab-leantime/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Home Server" /> <summary>Leantime is an open-source project management solution that can be considered an alternative to Asana, Monday.com, or ClickUp. Leantime provides project-based task management using Kanban boards, tabular, and calendar views. Additionally, it supports tracking milestones and goals for a project through Gantt charts. The most amazing feature is support for time tracking, where users can easily tr...</summary> </entry> <entry><title>GitHub Actions &amp; ARM Architecture</title><link href="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/gha-docker-arch/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GitHub Actions &amp;amp; ARM Architecture" /><published>2024-06-06T18:52:00-04:00</published> <updated>2024-06-06T18:52:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/gha-docker-arch/</id> <content src="https://tanishq.page/blog/posts/gha-docker-arch/" /> <author> <name>Tanishq Rupaal</name> </author> <category term="Computers and Security" /> <summary>This blog post covers my troubleshooting efforts and research on how we can use GitHub workflows for various architectures. It focuses more on how to build container images for ARM in the absence of native ARM runners and the state of such things in mid-2024 (this means any improvements made after mid-2024 were not considered when writing this content).
