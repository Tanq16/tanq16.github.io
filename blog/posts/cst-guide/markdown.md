> [!TIP]
> Since writing this blog, I've updated the [project](https://github.com/Tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit) significantly with multiple image options. The bulk of the usage below remains relevant, but the images are now named `cst-<variant>:arm` (or `amd` for x86_64). Refer to the newer and much more [detailed documentation](https://tanishq.page/containerized-security-toolkit/) for full details.

This blog is a guide on using the [Containerized Security Toolkit](https://github.com/Tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit), a project I maintain. The repository contains a quickstart command to instantly jump into a running instance. This guide, however, describes advanced workflows and usage of the toolkit.

## Quickstart

In this section, I describe a nuanced quickstart (includes a couple more settings than shown in the README) on using a containerized workflow. For a comprehensive and repeatable setup, check out the *Example Workflow* section further down in this blog post.

First, create a directory for persistence so that it can be mounted for container execution &rarr;

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/docker_work/
```

Next, run the image (Docker will pull it automatically) with a `zsh` command to start the SSH server and read `/dev/null` to keep the image alive &rarr;

```bash
# Change tag to main_apple to use on ARM64 systems
docker run --name="security_docker" \
-v $HOME/docker_work/:/persist \
--rm -d -it tanq16/sec_docker:main \
zsh -c "tail -f /dev/null"
```

Then, use `docker exec` to get a shell into the container &rarr;

```bash
docker exec -it security_docker /bin/zsh
```

Finally, run the following after getting into the container (*this is particularly useful if you follow my [CLI-Productivity-Suite](https://github.com/Tanq16/cli-productivity-suite/tree/master)*) &rarr;

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color && rm -rf /etc/localtime && \
ln -s "/usr/share/zoneinfo/$(curl -s https://ipapi.co/timezone)" /etc/localtime && \
echo $(curl -s https://ipapi.co/timezone) > /etc/timezone
```

Data that needs to be persisted across container runs should live in the `/persist/` directory, which is present on the host at `$HOME/docker_work/` (created earlier).

To stop the container after working on it, use the following &rarr;

```bash
docker stop security_docker -t 0
```

> [!DANGER]
> ***Note*** &rarr; One known issue that may come up is that the terminal colors may not behave in the best manner through the shell opened by Docker `exec`. This can be fixed by using SSH instead. The way to do this along with other customization is explained in the *Example Workflow* section next.

## Example Workflow

This is an example of setting up a more robust workflow for use in day to day life. I use this for my workflow and it works fantastically! The idea behind this workflow is as follows &rarr;

1. Use a single command to launch a container
2. SSH into the container without hunting for what the password is
3. Use dynamic port forwarding with SSH to reach services exposed within the container
4. Persist a volume as well as the command history to make use of shell completion features of `oh-my-zsh`
5. Use a single command to stop the container

Implementing all of that is a one-time setup and fairly easy to follow (just looks super detailed). Use the following command to make the necessary directory structure for persistence &rarr;

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/docker_work/
```

After that, add the following shell functions to the respective shell rc file &rarr;

```bash
# Start Container Function
start_work(){
    # run the container
    docker run --name="sec_docker" --rm -d \
    -v $HOME/docker_work/:/persist -p 50022:22 $@ -it tanq16/sec_docker:main \
    zsh -c "service ssh start; cp /persist/.zsh_history /root/.zsh_history; tail -f /dev/null"
    # create a new password for SSH-ing into the docker image
    new_pass=$(cat /dev/random | head -c 20 | base64 | tr -d '=+/')
    # print the new password and store in a file in the current directory
    echo "Password: $new_pass"
    echo $new_pass > current_docker_password
    # set the new password
    docker exec -e newpp="$new_pass" sec_docker zsh -c 'echo "root:$(printenv newpp)" | chpasswd'
}

# Stop Container Function
stop_work(){
    # copy (save) the command history
    docker cp sec_docker:/root/.zsh_history $HOME/docker_work/.zsh_history
    docker stop sec_docker -t 0
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Replace `main` tag with `main_apple` for ARM64 machines.

With that done, the two functions above accomplish the following &rarr;

- `start_work()` &rarr;
  - It starts the container in a detached state and keeps it alive with `tail -f /dev/null`
  - It exposes port `22` at host's port `50022` for SSH
  - It accepts any additional Docker arguments (due to `$@`), like more port mappings or volume mounts
  - It copies over the previous `.zsh_history` to maintain history across container runs
  - It sets the root password to something random, prints it out, and puts it in a file
- `stop_work()` &rarr;
  - It copies over the shell history from the container to the persistence directory
  - It then stops the container

> [!TIP]
> ***Tip*** &rarr; On MacOS, add `echo $new_pass | pbcopy` to the `start_work()` function to automatically copy the password to the clipboard.

Next, restart the shell or source the shell rc file, after which, the workflow can be used as follows &rarr;

```bash
# prints the password to SSH into the container
$ start_work
Password: pEBlVd1eBLkw01TlNpNtk4Xm6A

# ssh into the container with dynamic port forwarding
$ ssh root@localhost -p 50022 -D 65500
```

Then, use this inside the container (*especially if you use my [CLI-Productivity-Suite](https://github.com/Tanq16/cli-productivity-suite/tree/master)*) &rarr;

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color && rm -rf /etc/localtime && \
ln -s "/usr/share/zoneinfo/$(curl -s https://ipapi.co/timezone)" /etc/localtime && \
echo $(curl -s https://ipapi.co/timezone) > /etc/timezone
```

Finally, after completing your work, exit the SSH session and stop the container with the `stop_work` command.

> [!INFO]
> ***Note:*** Once you start `vim`, refer to the [Post Installation Steps of my CLI Productivity Suite](https://github.com/Tanq16/cli-productivity-suite/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#post-installation-steps), as the container uses that suite by default.

While this workflow uses SSH (and there are reasons for it I talk about later), similar functions without the SSH requirements (instead only using `docker exec`) can be written as follows &rarr;

```bash
shell_work(){
    docker exec -it sec_docker_direct zsh
}
begin_work(){
    docker run --name="sec_docker_direct" --rm -v $HOME/docker_work/:/persist -d -it tanq16/sec_docker:main
    docker exec sec_docker_direct zsh -c 'cp /persist/.zsh_history /root/.zsh_history'
}
end_work(){
    # copy (save) the command history
    docker cp sec_docker_direct:/root/.zsh_history $HOME/docker_work/.zsh_history
    docker stop sec_docker_direct -t 0
}
```

For the exec-based workflow, the sequence should be `begin_work`, then `shell_work` to get a shell into the container, and finally `end_work` to stop the container.

## Conventions

In this section, I talk about the conventions I use and recommend when using this image. The toolkit image is primarily meant to be used as a linux system for work. The idea is to have a single container with a persistent storage across multiple container runs. The `.zsh_history` file is also automatically copied in and out from the container by the start and stop functions.

The container was generally built with the intention of SSH-ing into it and making use of `tmux` to work in. While they can be exec-ed into as well, using SSH with `tmux` has the following advantages &rarr;

- The container can be deployed on various machines (like cloud VMs) and then SSH-ed into via non-standard ports
- Using SSH allows dynamic port forwarding allowing easy access to any services exposed within the container
- It fixes certain visual discrepancies that appear when exec-ing into the image (like the shell autocompletion color being overridden by solid white, making it weird to look at)

The password is randomly generated and stored in the `current_docker_password` file in the current directory to use if you exit the SSH session and connect again.

The `start_work` function also includes a `$@`, mainly to add other port publish arguments or volume mounts arguments if necessary. One such example is for adding a Go-lang based directory structure, which can be done with the following argument passed to the `start_work` command &rarr;

```
-v /path/to/host/go_programs/:/root/go/src
```

Other general conventions followed for building/running the images are &rarr;

- Port mapping follows convention - `shared port` = `port + 50000`
- Port for dynamic port forwarding when SSH-ing into the container = `65500`
- Volume mount to `/persist` (helps with persistence across runs or sessions)
- General tools and installed under the `/opt` directory in the container, while executables are in `/opt/executables` (respective paths are already added in the container's rc file)
- Optionally maintain a `run.sh` in the persist directory file for custom initialization setup to run when the container starts

## Image Builds

The toolkit image is built via CI/CD pipelines and published to DockerHub. As such, the image is ready to pull like so &rarr;

```bash
docker pull tanq16/sec_docker:main # or use main_apple for ARM64
```

> [!INFO]
> The builds are pretty large in size due to some tools like `az-cli`. So the images are approximately 7-8 GB in size.

The containers can be built by cloning my repository and using `docker build` command as follows &rarr;

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit
cd containerized-security-toolkit/security_docker_amd # security_docker_arm for ARM64
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f builder.Dockerfile -t intermediate_builder .
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t sec_docker .
docker builder prune # cleanup storage
```

## Bonus

This section includes some quick productivity tips!

To use python based tools from the container, activate the python environment in the container with the following command &rarr;

```bash
source /opt/pyenv/bin/activate
```

To SSH into the container without adding details to the hosts file, use the following command &rarr;

```bash
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" root@localhost -p 50232
```

You can also add the following alias to your host's rc file for ease of use &rarr;

```bash
alias sshide='ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null"'
```
    
This alias is automatically setup if you use my [CLI Productivity Suite](https://github.com/tanq16/cli-productivity-suite) on the host machine.

To remove dangling images when refreshing with new builds, use the following `docker rm` command (setup as an alias in my CLI Productivity Suite) &rarr;

```bash
alias dockernonerm='for i in $(docker images -f dangling=true -q); do docker image rm $i; done'
```

## Conclusion

I hope this blog post gives insight into how to use my containerized toolkit image for cybersecurity-related workflows. I use this container for my day-to-day work as a security professional and I found that it significantly improved my productivity across any environment or operating system I choose to work on. Cheers!
